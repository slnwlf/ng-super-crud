Hm, I really struggled with this assignment.  I think I need to go back and do some basic CRUD / routing work.  Maybe the original Super-Crud assignment.  I think what I need is a step by step tutorial to go through basic building of CRUD routes.  Maybe for Spotify or for Books.   Or Wine.  

I know a few of my classmates are also struggling with the back-end.  I'd really like to get more comfortable with back-end setup before the class is over.    Both Javascript and the back-end are challenging for me, but I'd love to have a go-to example of basic CRUD routes that I can reference as I build Project 3 and other apps.   I don't expect to get really good at the back-end in the near term, but I'd like to increase my comfort level with it. 

Hoping we have time to take a step back and revisit Super-Crud.  If not I'll have to revisit it after the course.
